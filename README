This is the code for [Anagram Thief](http://dcliu.com/projects/anagram-thief/), which is a real-time multiplayer word game in which you race to build words from letter tiles, and you can steal your opponentsâ€™ words by rearranging and adding letters.

Updated to run on Rails 4

First time you run it:

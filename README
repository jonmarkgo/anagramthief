This is the code for [Anagram Thief](http://dcliu.com/projects/anagram-thief/), which is a real-time multiplayer word game in which you race to build words from letter tiles, and you can steal your opponentsâ€™ words by rearranging and adding letters.

Updated to run on Rails 4

To execute:
move .env.sample to .env and fill in vars

in wordlists dir:
ruby import-inflects.rb 2+2lemma.txt
ruby import-wordlist.rb TWL06.txt twl06

in ai dir:
./dev_launch or prod_launch

in script dir:
./dev-app_server or ./prod-app_server

in node dir:
./dev-launch or ./prod-launch

Lastly, run rails server (looks like some of the other services need to be up before it runs successfully)
